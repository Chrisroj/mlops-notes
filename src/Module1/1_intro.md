***MLOps*** is a _set of best practices_ for bringing Machine Learning to production.

Machine Learning projects can be simpplified to just 3 steps:

1. ***Design*** - is ML the right tool for solving our problem?
   * _We want to predict the duration of a taxi trip. Do we need to use ML or can we used a simpler rule-based model?_
2. ***Train*** - if we do need ML, then we train and evaluate the best model.
3. ***Operate*** - model deployment, management and monitoring.

MLOps is helpful in all 3 stages.
